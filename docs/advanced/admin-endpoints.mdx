## Philosophy

GOModel ships with admin endpoints **enabled by default**. The goal is simple: you should be able to deploy GOModel and immediately have visibility into what's happening — no extra services, no separate monitoring stack, no configuration.

The admin layer is split into two independently controllable pieces:

1. **Admin REST API** (`/admin/api/v1/*`) — machine-readable JSON endpoints for usage data and model inventory. Protected by `GOMODEL_MASTER_KEY` like all other API routes.
2. **Admin Dashboard UI** (`/admin/dashboard`) — a lightweight, embedded HTML dashboard that visualizes the same data. No external dependencies, no JavaScript frameworks to install — it's compiled into the binary.

Both are on by default because observability shouldn't be opt-in. If you don't need them, turn them off with a single environment variable.

## Configuration

| Variable                  | Description                          | Default |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `ADMIN_ENDPOINTS_ENABLED` | Enable the admin REST API            | `true`  |
| `ADMIN_UI_ENABLED`        | Enable the admin dashboard UI        | `true`  |

Or in YAML:

```yaml
admin:
  endpoints_enabled: true
  ui_enabled: true
```

<Note>
  The dashboard UI requires the REST API to be enabled. If you set
  `ADMIN_ENDPOINTS_ENABLED=false` but leave `ADMIN_UI_ENABLED=true`, the UI
  will be automatically disabled with a warning in the logs.
</Note>

## Authentication

The admin REST API endpoints (`/admin/api/v1/*`) are protected by the same `GOMODEL_MASTER_KEY` authentication as the main API routes. Include the key as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOMODEL_MASTER_KEY" \
  http://localhost:8080/admin/api/v1/usage/summary
```

The dashboard UI pages (`/admin/dashboard`) and static assets (`/admin/static/*`) **skip authentication** so the dashboard is accessible without configuring API keys in the browser.

<Warning>
  If your GOModel instance is publicly accessible, be aware that the dashboard
  UI is unauthenticated. Disable it with `ADMIN_UI_ENABLED=false` or restrict
  access at the network level.
</Warning>

## REST API Endpoints

All admin API endpoints are mounted under `/admin/api/v1`.

### GET /admin/api/v1/usage/summary

Returns aggregate token usage statistics over a configurable time window.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description               | Default |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| `days`    | int  | Number of days to look back | `30`  |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "total_requests": 1542,
  "total_input_tokens": 2450000,
  "total_output_tokens": 890000,
  "total_tokens": 3340000
}
```

If usage tracking is disabled, returns zeroed values.

### GET /admin/api/v1/usage/daily

Returns per-day token usage breakdown over a configurable time window.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description               | Default |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| `days`    | int  | Number of days to look back | `30`  |

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2026-02-17",
    "requests": 84,
    "input_tokens": 120000,
    "output_tokens": 45000,
    "total_tokens": 165000
  },
  {
    "date": "2026-02-16",
    "requests": 102,
    "input_tokens": 155000,
    "output_tokens": 58000,
    "total_tokens": 213000
  }
]
```

Returns an empty array if usage tracking is disabled or no data exists for the period.

### GET /admin/api/v1/models

Returns all registered models with their provider type.

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "model": {
      "id": "gpt-4o",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1715367049,
      "owned_by": "system"
    },
    "provider_type": "openai"
  },
  {
    "model": {
      "id": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1727568000,
      "owned_by": "system"
    },
    "provider_type": "anthropic"
  }
]
```

This differs from the standard `/v1/models` endpoint: the admin version includes `provider_type` for each model, making it useful for understanding which provider serves which model.

## Admin Dashboard

The dashboard is a server-rendered HTML page embedded in the GOModel binary. Access it at:

```
http://localhost:8080/admin/dashboard
```

It provides a visual overview of usage statistics and registered models using the same data as the REST API endpoints above.

## Disabling Admin Features

To disable all admin features:

```bash
export ADMIN_ENDPOINTS_ENABLED=false
```

This disables both the REST API and the dashboard UI. To keep the API but hide the dashboard:

```bash
export ADMIN_ENDPOINTS_ENABLED=true
export ADMIN_UI_ENABLED=false
```

<Tip>
  The admin layer is designed to degrade gracefully. If usage tracking is off,
  the usage endpoints return empty results instead of errors. If the model
  registry isn't ready, the models endpoint returns an empty array. The gateway
  keeps running regardless.
